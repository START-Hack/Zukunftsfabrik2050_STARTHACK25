## <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>
<p align="center">Zukunft-Fabrik.2050 offers an open and independent platform for positive visions and the shaping of the future and brings them into the dialog between the public, politics, science and business.</p>

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>
<p align="center"> Management models like the St. Gallen Management Model are often learned by heart during studies but are rarely applied effectively in practice. As a result, their potential for decision-making, strategy development, and daily operations remains underutilized. </p>

## <p align="center"> Expected Outcome: </p>
-	A mockup of a digital app that transforms the St. Gallen Management Model into an interactive tool with simplified user experience that provides sources to insure high data quality.
-	It is designed in a way, similar to Google maps, starting with a 10.000ft view. From there you can zoom deeper into the underneath layers until you finally “land” where you want to be.
-	In addition, here is an interesting illustration for displaying more in-depth content: https://businessmodelnavigator.com/network 
-	On this level you can receive tailored content for your particular situation (combination of personas, markets, maturity level of a company, size of the enterprise, degree of technology adoption,…). Any of these combinations will display as a dimension (N:N:N relationships).
-	It is supported by an AI, heavily based on material provided by HSG
-	It is also able to integrate HSG external resources (industry benchmarks, white papers, photos, videos)
-	It uses the “official” HSG vocabulary, to ensure easy recognition. This could be presented in WIKI like style or any other kind of dictionary.
###  Ensure that three walkthroughs will be presented as mockup:
-	Manager of a big health care company needs to decide how to implement quantum computing.
-	Finance manager of a SMU needs decision support if his company should stay on their Swiss location or rather move abroad (value stream analysis)
-	Student in his last semester wants to put together a strategy document for his first startup.
-	Future users will be: Students, managers, entrepreneurs, teachers and HSG alumni seeking to apply the model practically in strategy, operations and education.
